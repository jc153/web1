<h2>Computer Security Certifications</h2>
<img src="smugglers-lair.jpg" width="50%">
<p>In the Computer security or Information security fields, there are a number of tracks a professional can take to demonstrate qualifications. Four sources categorizing these, and many other credentials, licenses and certifications, are: 1. Schools and Universities; 2. "Vendor" sponsored credentials (e.g. Microsoft, Cisco); 3. Association and Organization sponsored credentials; 4. Governmental (or quasi governmental) body sponsored licenses, certifications and credentials.
Quality and acceptance vary worldwide for IT security credentials, from well-known and high quality examples like a master's degree in the field from an accredited school, CISSP, and Microsoft certification, to a controversial list of many dozens of lesser known credentials and organizations.
In addition to certification obtained by taking courses and/or passing exams (and in the case of CISSP and others noted below, demonstrating experience and/or being recommended or given a reference from an existing credential holder), award certificates also are given for winning government, university or industry sponsored competitions, including team competitions and contests.</p>
